# Cryptococcus_Kwoniella_MAT_evol
Evolution of MAT loci in Cryptococcus and Kwoniella

# Introduction
This repository contains scripts and data supporting the analysis of _MAT_ loci in _Cryptococcus_ and _Kwoniella_, as presented in Coelho & David-Palma et al., 2025 (under revision)

# Scripts and Data
This repository includes Python and R scripts for statistical analysis and visualization, along with tree files and raw data.
Files are organized by figure for ease of reference and reproducibility.
> **Note:** The figures generated by these scripts serve as the foundation for the final published versions, which were refined for clarity and presentation using Adobe Illustrator while maintaining scale and proportions.
